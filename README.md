# SurrogateTV-Developed-Games
Both game scripts I have developed for SurrogateTV. 

## SurroBros
SurroBros was launched on November 1st, 2020

Smash Bros Ultimate for the Switch was able to be played on the internet anywhere in the world by up to 4 players at a time. This was developed early in the surrortg-sdk development cycle when it was still in beta access. I was able to not only develop this but I was able to expand upon known ways to interface with the Switch through the SDK to allow up to 5 players at a time (settled for 4) off of a single Raspberry Pi 4 as opposed to the maximum at the time of 1 player per Pi. 

This game was taken offline for good on January 21st, 2021 due a user finding a way to get out of the game, into my Switch's settings, and factory reset it (resetting over 500 hours of game data and saves outside of Smash Bros). 

## BOTW
BOTW was launched on Feburary 5th, 2021

Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Switch was able to be played on the internet anywhere in the world. Using the site's WePlay Model (Users get increments of time to compelte a game together), I made BOTW. Determined to not have the same outcome as SurroBros, I spent the between time setting up quite a number of IR trigger points to mitigate and stop users from getting to unintended menues and settings. Being that I was already developing a ton of IR triggers, I decided to make the game a more interactive experience, instead of the score on the site being "Games Played", I would have the game regocnize key points and items and hand out points. This would make it a competative, yet collaborative experience. 

This game is currently running and can be played at https://surrogate.tv/game/botw

## Super Mario Odyssey 
SMO was launched on March 19th, 2021 and is part of the RePlay game catalogue

Super Mario Odyssey for the Switch was able to be played on the internet anywhere in the world. Using the site's WePlay Model (Users get increments of time to compelte a game together), I made SMO. Extending what I learned from BOTW, I was able to easily get frames of data that could be used as IR trigger poitns to mitigate and stop users from getting to unintended menues and settings.
